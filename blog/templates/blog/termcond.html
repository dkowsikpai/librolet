								<dt><b>Personal Subscription Services</b></dt>
								<dd><p>Contract formation:


Business Standard will try to process your subscription promptly but does not guarantee that your subscription will be activated by any specified time. 
By submitting your payment and other subscription details, you are making an offer to us to buy a subscription. 
Your offer will only be accepted by us and a contract formed when we have successfully verified your payment details and email address, at which point
 we will provide you with access to your subscription. Business Standard reserves the right to reject any offer 
in its discretion, for any or no reason.

Business Standard may partner with third party content providers to offer bundled services, under which the payment for both the services will be collected 
by Business Standard. Business Standard will endeavor to provide a seamless access to all such third 
parties with a single one point access. There could be a gap in this seamless access due to a technology breakdown, temporary disconnection of the internet
 connection or any factors beyond the reasonable control of Business Standard. In such cases the 
contract will be formed once the access to the partner services are restored.

You are requested to read through the terms and conditions offered by content partners to Business Standard. Most partners offer bundled services for new 
users. Existing subscribers of partners are not eligible for bundled subscription. Should you happen
 to be one please note that the partner will be liable to reject your offer to subscribe under the bundled subscription not leading to contract formation 
 as a result.

Payment details:

When you purchase a subscription, you must provide us with complete and accurate payment information. By submitting payment details you promise that you
 are entitled to purchase a subscription using those payment details. If we do not receive payment 
authorization or any authorization is subsequently cancelled, we may immediately terminate or suspend your access to your subscription. In suspicious 
circumstances we may contact the issuing bank/payment provider and/or law enforcement authorities or other 
appropriate third parties. If you are entitled to a refund under these terms and conditions we will credit that refund to the card or other payment 
method you used to submit payment, unless it has expired in which case we will contact you.

Business Standard will use the services of quality third party payment service providers to process your payment. Payment options are primarily through
 credit card. Business Standard may offer other payment mechanisms from time to time.

The subscription price will be made clear to you on our sign-up pages or otherwise during the sign-up process and may vary from time to time, by region

 you subscribe and cannot be changed during the term of your subscription. We will always tell you in advance 
 of any increase in the price of your subscription and offer you an opportunity to cancel it if you do not wish to pay the new price.</p></dd>
